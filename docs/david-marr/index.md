+ British neuroscientist and physiologist

## Marr's Three Levels
Famously known for its framework about solution to any information processing problem (IPP). It consists of **3 parts**:

### 1. Computational Theory (CT)
+ It is the fundamental formulea of the solution (if there is any).
+ Depends on nature of the problem.
+ It never has to be done again. There could only be one unique CT for any IPP.
+ It is about the goal and logic of the solution.

### 2. Representation & Algorithm
+ It is about how to compute (implement) a solution.
+ Depend on hardware
+ Could be many for the same task unlike CT

### 3. Hardware Implementation
+ It is about how to realize the algorithm.

## Type 1 and Type 2 Theories
According to Marr, there are 2 types of solutions to a problem based on whether there is any computational theory:

### Type 1 Theory
If there is a Computational Theory to the problem, it is a type 1 theory. Not all problems have that. Computational Theory provides a prediction about what exactly the problem and the solution are supposed to be doing.
Examples: Fundamental laws of physics and mathematics...

### Type 2 Theory
When a problem is solved by simultaneous action of a considerable number of processes, it is a Type 2 theory.
Examples: protein folding, deep neural networks...

### Insights
+ Marr says that Type 1 results are much more important. But Type 2 Theories are required for scientific progress.
+ We should focus on Type 1 theories, so lets focus on fundamental problems (especially in Artificial Intelligence).
+ Type 2 Theories are important based on their performance. If there is no performance, they should be judged harshly.

## Quotes
> All important fields of human endeavour start with personal commitment based on faith rather than on results. AI is just one more example. Only a sour, crabbed and unadventurous spirit will hold it against us.
